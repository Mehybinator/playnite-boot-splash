# playnite-boot-splash

This program is another imagination of a specifice workaround in batch script. It uses VLC but you can extend it to use any video player, like ffplay from the original batch script.

Build using:
```go
go build -ldflags "-H=windowsgui" -o ".\build\Playnite Fullscreen.exe"
```
